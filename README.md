## About this project

I am trying learn how to make a very lightweight database search website. I found Astro as it boasts a very lightweight and responsive framework. Having tinkered with Next.js and React I found this to be a simpler way to query an sql database locally. However, I have had a lot of troubles on figuring out the "best practices" way to implement the search api with pagiantion. I would love to recieve any feedback or forks of this with changes for me to learn from!

Thank you for reading this, and if you would like to leave any feeback feel free to contact me on discord at Jaykubz :\)
